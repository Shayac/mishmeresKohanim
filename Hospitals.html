				<dt>Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch NJ</dt>
				<dd>Kohanim may enter both via the main lobby or the emergency room. It is now permissible for a Kohen to remain on the first two floors even for an extended period of time.</dd>

				<dt>Jersey Shore Medical Center, Neptune NJ</dt>
				<dd>Kohanim may enter the hospital and go to all the floors if needed.</dd>

				<dt>Ocean Medical Center, Brick NJ</dt>
				<dd>Kohanim may enter the hospital and go to all the floors.</dd>

				<dt>Monmouth Medical Center, Southern Campus (Kimball Hospital), Lakewood NJ</dt>
				<dd>Kohanim may enter the hospital both through the first floor entrance and the emergency department and may go to all floors. In regards to Dr. Lebowits’s Specialty Department (5th and 6th floors), the likelihood of טומאה is small, so a Kohen may enter there as well. Preferably one should try to find out from one of the frum staff members if there is a מת on the floor, or if a מיתה is imminent. However, if one is unable to find out this information, he may still enter.</dd>

				<dt>Community Medical Center, Toms River NJ</dt>
				<dd>The chances of טומאת ישראל are small, but there is a constant סוף טומאה לצאת of טומאת עכו”ם so if a Kohen has a צורך to enter, he should consult with a Rov.</dd>

				<dt>Robert Wood Johnson, New Brunswick NJ</dt>
				<dd>
					<ol>
						<li>The Cancer Institute building is OK for Kohanim.</li>
						<li>Main hospital building: The chances of טומאת ישראל are small but there is almost certainly טומאת אוהל of טומאת עכו”ם immediately upon entering the hospital from 7:30 am until 6:00 pm Monday through Friday. At any other time, there is almost certainly סוף טומאה לצאת of טומאת עכו”ם. Therefore if a Kohen has a צורך to enter, he should consult with a Rov.
						Additionally there is סוף טומאה לצאת of טומאת עכו”ם in the main parking garage; an alternative garage is located a few blocks away at 10 Plum Street, New Brunswick NJ.</li>
						<li>
							Some doctors who are affiliated with RWJ have offices in a building right next to the hospital that is connected to the hospital by a bridge, including amongst others, Dr. Rosen, a high risk ob/gyn. The address of the building is 125 Patterson St.
							That building is OK, with the following precautions.
							<ul>
								<li>125 Patterson has its own parking lot. It is best to park there and not in the main hospital parking garage, to avoid the סוף טומאה לצאת of .טומאת עכו”ם</li>
								<li>The third floor has a bridge to the main hospital, which brings the טומאת אוהל of טומאת עכו”ם from the hospital to that floor.
									<small>Please note: While almost no doctors see patients on the third floor, some of the elevators only go until that floor, and one would need to transfer to another elevator to get to a higher floor. This can be avoided by checking that the elevator goes directly to the floor needed before going up.</small>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Little Albany St. which is right in front of the hospital has סוף טומאה לצאת of טומאת עכו”ם, due to an overpass running over the street that connects to the parking garage.
							While it can usually be avoided, if a Kohen has a need to go there, a Rov should be consulted.</li>

				<dt>Children’s Hospital Of Philadelphia (C.H.O.P), Philadelphia PA</dt>
				<dd>There is very little חשש of טומאת מת in the emergency room, and all of the hallways and common areas of the hospital, thus allowing Kohanim to enter the emergency room as well as all common areas. This includes but is not limited to the parking garage, main entrance, atrium, and the outpatient facility. A Kohen may also enter other departments במקום צורך.
				If there are any other regional hospitals about which one would like information please contact Mishmeres Kohanim and we will try to assist you.</dd>

				<dt>Hackensack Medical Center</dt>
				<dd>
					<ol>
						<li>Parking lot is ok</li>
						<li>Women and Children building is ok</li>
						<li>Main Hospital Building: A Kohen may enter if there is a tzorech. He should not remain on the main floor longer than necessary.</li>
						<li>Outpatient Radiation: If a Kohen wishes to accompany a choleh there, a Rav should be consulted.</li>
